# Minesweeper

`React.JS` `TypeScript` `CSS3`

## About

Minesweeper was the most difficult game for me to play on Windows on my first computer in the 90's, and now even better than being able to beat it, I can build it programmatically from scratch! In order to view the site and play the game go to [the deployed app on my site](http://kelley-sharp-minesweeper.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/).

## How to run this app locally

1. Clone this repository into a new directory.

2. In the project directory, run:

- ### `npm install` or `yarn install`

- This will install all the dependencies you need.

3. Now run:

- ### `npm start`

- This will run the app in development mode.<br>
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
