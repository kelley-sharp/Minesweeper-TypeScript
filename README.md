# Minesweeper

`React.JS` `TypeScript` `CSS3`

## About

On my first Windows computer in the 90's, Minesweeper was the most difficult of the Entertainment Pack games for me to play. That's why I wanted to build it programmatically from scratch. I still loose Minesweeper most of the time, but the real win is the satisfaction of knowing how it works.

In order to view the site and play the game go [here](http://kelley-sharp-minesweeper.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/).
